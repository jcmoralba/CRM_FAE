Model ID: 13054

Item Name: Pro 100, 1/2", Industrial Ratchet Production 'P' Type

Description: 
TW MDL100 P TYPE 1/2 PTR

Specification:
P' Type Torque Wrenches are designed for the production environment where they will be set and then dedicated to a particular application. There is no scale, the wrench must be set against a torque testing device such as Norbar's Professional Torque Tester. The push-through ratchets on these models are robustly engineered for strength and durability. The strength and high wear resistance comes from a coarse tooth pattern while a principle of offset ratchet pawls gives a narrow engagement angle. The push-through square drive is not only a robust design but allows the wrench to be used for torque control in both the clockwise and anti clockwise directions, and allows for a wider model range of up to 400 Nm.
 
 Features
Setting system is designed to discourage unauthorised alteration.
Coloured end seals are provided to identify the wrench to a particular operator, torque setting or calibration period.
Available with a high quality ratchet or as a 'Torque Handle'.
Retained square drive will not pull out of the head when the socket is removed.
Supplied in a moulded box for storage and protection.
On request PType wrenches can be set, marked with the setting and certified for production line applications requiring a sealed torque setting. Only if a pre-set has been requested will the tool be supplied with a Declaration of Conformance
