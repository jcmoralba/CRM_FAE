Model ID: 15102

Item Name: Pro 50, 9 x 12 mm Female Torque Handle Adjustable (Dual Scale)

Description: 
TH MDL 50 PROF 9x12

Specification:
Norbar Torque Handles are based on the 'Professional' wrench range and share the same high precision engineering. The Female End versions are either 9 x 12 mm or 14 x 18 mm rectangular type. For many applications a spanner end fitting rather than a socket is the best or, often, the only solution. Typically this will be because the joint is a pipe union (such as a brake pipe).
